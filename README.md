# Pi Retrogaming

Retrogaming on the Raspberry Pi

## What can you emulate

| Pi Version | Console |
|---|---|
| 1 | Turbo Grafx 15 |
| 1 overclocked, Zero, 2 | NES, Turbo Grafx 16, Genesis, SNES<sup>1</sup>, GBA |
| 2<sup>2</sup>, 3 | 8-bit, 16-bit, N64<sup>3</sup>, PS1 |

* 1 - Games with special chips may run poorly. 2 - I don't own a Pi 2 so I'm just going by what the internet says. 3 - N64 emulation, generally, runs poorly.

## Controllers

I've used with success:

- PS2 Dualshock with USB adapter
- PS3 over bluetooth
- Xbox 360 with USB dongle (knockoff from Amazon)

## Distros

There is Retropie and there's Lakka. I personally like Lakka for the fast bootup, consistent UI (Playstation Ribbon) and ease of use. Retropie, however, is much more popular maybe due to it being older and support much more consoles and even older computers.
