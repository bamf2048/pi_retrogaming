## Retropad: What is it?

When you've configured the buttons on your game controller you're really mapping them to an imaginary controler called
the Retropad. This is a controller that is like the *Nintendo Pro Controller* with A button (right-most) being the primary button and the B (bottom-most) button being back/cancel button. You can swap A and B to be Xbox styled in Retroarch.
