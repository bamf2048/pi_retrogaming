# Pi Retrogaming

Retrogaming on the Raspberry Pi

## What can you emulate>

| Pi Version | Console |
|---|---|
| 1 | Turbo Grafx 15 |
| 1 overclocked, Zero, 2 | NES, Turbo Grafx 16, Genesis, SNES<sup>1</sup>, GBA |
| 2<sup>2</sup>, 3 | 8-bit, 16-bit, N64<sup>3</sup>, PS1 |

* 1 - Games with special chips may run poorly. 2 - I don't own a Pi 2 so I'm just going by what the internet says. 3 - N64 emulation, generally, runs poorly.
