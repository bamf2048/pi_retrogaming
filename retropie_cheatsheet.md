# Retropie Cheatsheet

Useful hotkeys:

Remember: Retropie is the over-arching OS and menu that lets you choose a system and set system-side settings. 
Retroarch is the frontend for the console -- for all intents and purposes this is the emulator (it's really not -- 
the emulation is handled by drivers that Retroarch loads).
