# Retropie Cheatsheet

## Useful hotkeys/buttons while playing:

| Button Combo | Action |
|---|---|
| Select + Start | Back to Retropie |
| Select + L1 | Load State |
| Select + R1 | Save State |
| Select + Dpad Left | State Slot - |
| Select + Dpad Right | State Slot + |
| Select + x | Retroarch Menu |
| Select + b | Reset |

Remember: Retropie is the over-arching OS and menu that lets you choose a system and set system-side settings. 
Retroarch is the frontend for the console -- for all intents and purposes this is the emulator (it's really not -- 
the emulation is handled by drivers that Retroarch loads).
