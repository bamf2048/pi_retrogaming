# Retropie Enhancements

These are enhancments that aren't installed by default but that I think pretty cool.


## Demo mode

This script plays a random games like a slideshow.

Install on a Pie, connect to your network via ethernet and play on a browser on your PC.

## Add "Pixel" Desktop

This is a full graphic UI with Chromium. You might find it easier to manage files using this.

In Emulationstation, go to Retropie Setup > Configuration / Tools > Raspbiantools > Install Pixel Desktop Environment.

You can go to the desktop in the Ports menu in Emulationstation or type `startx` from the terminal.


### Add Synaptic to Pixel Desktop

Allows you to easily install desktop applications. Synaptic is the App Store before there was the App Store.

```
sudo apt install synaptic
```
